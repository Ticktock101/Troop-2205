                    <p class="text-sm">Scouts BSA Troop 2205, located in the Northeast corner of Fort Worth, Texas.  
                        Cris Cross was looking to start an All Girl Troop as his scouts from Pack 88 were getting ready to cross over into Scouts BSA.  He Approached Bill Begole, the Scouts BSA Charter Organization Representative at Alliance United Methodist Church, where
                        Scouts BSA Troop 205, Cub Scout Pack 205, and Venture Crew 205 already existed.
                        Chris recruited adult leaders from Pack 88,  Ray and Katie Harris, Samantha McClung, Vanessa Coleman, along with Scott Lindgren, a past Scoutmaster from Troop 336, Peggy Chen from Troop 336 for advancements, Scott McAllister, an Assisant Scoutmaster from Troop 205 to begin the creation of Troop 2205.
                        So in the Fall of 2018 it all started to gel and we started putting the plan together to start the Troop 2205.  A Troop 2205 Committee was formed, Chris Cross was the first Committee Chair and Scott Lindgren was the first Scoutmaster.   We chartered Troop 2205 with 6 scouts and their families.  The Founding familes are the Coopers, Granthams, Harris', McClung/ Bateman's, Coleman/ Jones, Fields, Cross', Lindgren's, McAllister's, Stam's, and Michelle Sanford as our Unit Commissioner.
                        Our first activity was the Weekend in the Woods, put on by the Longhorn council.  It was on March 1-3, 2019, and was held at Worth Ranch Scout Ranch, in Palo Pinto, Texas.  The Scouts got their first experience of camping in the rain.  Which is something that followed us for the first year.  </p>

                            Victory Therapy Center is our new Charter Organization, as we enter a new chapter in the troops history.  Scouts BSA Troop 2205 provides a safe, 
                            fun environment for girls and young adults to build character, to learn the responsibilities of participating citizenship, and to develop personal fitness, all while learning valuable leadership skills! </p>

                        <p class="text-sm">The leaders of Troop 2205 are the Scouts themselves.  Empowering the Scouts to be leaders is the core of Scouting.

                            Scouts learn by doing.  What they do is lead their patrols and the troop.  Our Scouts have developed the Troopâ€™s program for each month and for the coming year.  We follow the Patrol Method.  The Patrol Leader and her Assistant Patrol Leader guide their Scouts as they advance in rank, participate in activities, such as camping.
                            
                            As Scouts advance in rank and experience, they are able to attain a larger leadership role.  The Senior Patrol Leader not only leads the Patrol Leaders but she also has a staff that she leads for 6 months.  Her staff gives her the leadership and management capacity to ensure that the Troop runs smoothly.</p>
